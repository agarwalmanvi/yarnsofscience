This blog is meant as a space where I can share my love for science and my love for crochet. It serves as a way to document my crochet projects and explore my creative energies.

An interesting feature of this blog is that all my designs are original and I create the patterns for each project from scratch. This process is challenging and fun, where I must imagine the journey from the one-dimensional thread to two-dimensional surfaces to three-dimensional objects.

Welcome to my blog and I hope you enjoy looking around!
